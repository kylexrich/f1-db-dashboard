  <strong>Question 1 (3 pts)</strong>
  Consider the following program, on which we will use our Symbolic Execution technique for detecting any potential for assertion violations (runtime errors caused by assert statements):</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">foo</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> a)</span> </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> x = a + <span class="hljs-number">2</span>;

  <span class="hljs-keyword">while</span>(x &lt; <span class="hljs-number">11</span>) {
    x = x + <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">assert</span> x &lt;= <span class="hljs-number">11</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// (I)</span>
  }
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(x == <span class="hljs-number">3</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">assert</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">false</span>;   <span class="hljs-comment">// (II)</span>
  } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">assert</span> x != <span class="hljs-number">3</span>;  <span class="hljs-comment">// (III)</span>
  } <span class="hljs-comment">// stop before this line for 1(c)!</span>
}
</code></pre><p>(a) (0.6 pts) <em>Explain briefly how our Symbolic Execution technique is used in general to check a program for potential assertion violations and/or to show their absence.</em></p>
<p>(b) (0.4 pts) <em>What are the Failure Conditions for each of the lines labelled with (I), (II) and (III)?</em></p>
<p>Recall the over-approximate rule for loops we defined in our Symbolic Execution technique.</p>
<p>(c) (1.4 pts) <em>Apply the Symbolic Execution technique to the code provided, showing an abstract state (symbolic state + path conditions) for every non-empty line of code up to and including the last assert statements. Although it is the case that for an if-then-else construct one needs to split off two separate symbolic executions for the remainder of the program, since you are allowed to stop at the last assert statements you can show all of your answers next to a single copy of the code.</em></p>
<p>(d) (0.6 pts) <em>Explain how to use your results to check for potential assertion violations for each of the assert statements: describe each of the checks that needs to be made, and its result.
  Do your results suggest that there are any potential assertion violations or not?</em></p>

  <strong>Question 2 (2 pts)</strong></p>
<p>The simple rule for Symbolic Execution of loops (from Slide Deck 13) over-approximates the possible states the analysed program can actually reach.</p>
<p>Consider the following variant of the previous code:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">foo</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> a)</span> </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> x = a + <span class="hljs-number">2</span>;

  <span class="hljs-keyword">while</span>(x &lt; <span class="hljs-number">11</span>) {
    x = x + <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
  }
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(x == a + <span class="hljs-number">2</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">assert</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">false</span>;   <span class="hljs-comment">// (A)</span>
  } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">assert</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">false</span>;   <span class="hljs-comment">// (B)</span>
  }
}
</code></pre><p>Suppose that we are interested in test-case generation for this program: in particular, we would like to use Symbolic Execution to try to find test cases that reach each of the assert statements marked <code>(A)</code> and <code>(B)</code> above (this is what is meant by &quot;appropriate test cases&quot; in the questions below).</p>
<p>(a) (0.6 pts) <em>If we use the simple rule for Symbolic Execution of loops, what problem can we have when generating test-cases targeted to specific goals (e.g. in this case, covering a specific branch after the loop)? You might want to give an example of possible test cases that might be generated to explain your answer.</em></p>
<p>(b) (0.6 pts) <em>Suppose that we instead handle the loop via Bounded Loop Unrolling (as described in Slide Deck 14). Would this potentially help us with the problem you identified in part (a); i.e. to find appropriate test cases for this program? Briefly explain your answer.</em></p>
<p>(c) (0.8 pts) <em>Suppose instead that we (manually) add a loop invariant <code>x == a + 2 || x &lt;= 11</code> to the loop, and use this to strengthen the path conditions used in the original Symbolic Execution rule for loops (as described in Slide Deck 14). To what extent would this </em>necessarily<em> help us with the problem you identified in part (a); i.e. to find appropriate test cases for this program? Briefly explain your answer.</em></p>
<p>(d) (Unassessed) <em>Can you think of a stronger kind of loop invariant that could be integrated with our Symbolic Execution rules for loops, to make finding test cases easier still? Hint: loop invariants are at the moment expressed as boolean program expressions, but you might think of an alternative that would fit our Symbolic Execution rules better.</em></p>
